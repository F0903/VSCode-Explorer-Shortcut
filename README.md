# VSCode-Explorer-Shortcut
A tiny bat file to quickly launch VSCode with your current directory from the File Explorer address bar.

Put this file in a directory somewhere, then add that directory to the [Windows PATH](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7) and you're done!
You can now simply open your current folder in VSCode from the File Explorer address bar by typing "vscode" and pressing enter.

Note: 
If you manually changed your VSCode install location, you will have to tweak the path in the bat file.
