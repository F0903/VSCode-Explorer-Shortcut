# VSCode-Explorer-Shortcut

A tiny program that allows you to quickly open you current directory in VSCode from the File Explorer address line.

Simply compile the program, put it in a directory somewhere, rename it to "vscode.exe", and add this directory to the [Windows PATH](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7).
To use, open a directory and then type "vscode" in the address bar and hit enter.

If you don't have VSCode installed in the default location, you will have to create a system variable called "VSCODE_EXE" with the exact path to the VSCode executable.
